The bug found is related to the reuse of Random objects which possibly breaks the RNG aspect entirely, I do not believe this code meets quality standards.<br>
The mentioned security hotspot is also related to random possibly being predictable and is tagged as "Weak Cryptography", the fact that this euromillions project may be predictable (security risk is not accessed by sonarcube) makes it a failure.
