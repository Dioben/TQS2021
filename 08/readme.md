At class: Due to a VM partitioning work got delayed, user partition didn't have sufficient space at first.<br>
          After figuring that out the entire class was spent trying to get jenkins to run either as a normal user or as root, but by the end of the class I found out I only had a java RUNTIME, I partially installed jdk11-headless but left halfway through because my connection was slow.<br>
          Later at the same day attempts at running the same code told me they could not locate libawt_xawt.so for some reason,<br> I installed apt-file and used it to find packages with the file, finally getting a successful jenkins build
